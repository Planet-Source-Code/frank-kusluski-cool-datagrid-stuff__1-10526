## Cool Datagrid Stuff\!


</div>

### Description

This sample VB app shows you how to add drop down

lists to columns in a data grid. Other cool

features include drag and drop from a Listbox to

a cell in the grid, sort grid data by clicking

the column header, and how to add a split to the

grid in run-time mode. Please vote!
 
### More Info
 
The ADO Data Control's (adodc1) ConnectionString

property is set to the following:

Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=D:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VB98\Biblio.mdb;Persist Security Info=False

If the BIBLIO.MDB database resides in a different

directory on your machine you will need to change

the Data Source location. On most machines this

file will exist on the C drive though.

None that I know of.
